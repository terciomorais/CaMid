# M-CaMid
Multi-Cloud-aware Middleware
M-CaMid (Multi-Cloud aware Middleware) is an object-oriented middleware specially designed for supporting the development and management of distributed applications in multi-cloud environments. The proposed middleware implements cloud elasticity at the middleware level and abstracts the underlying distribution complexities inherent to multi-cloud infrastructures. In practice, M-CaMid implements essential mechanisms to support: (i) communication between the applicationâ€™s components distributed over multiple clouds; and (ii) management of distributed applications and their infrastructure resources with minimal human intervention by leveraging the cloud elasticity benefit automatically and transparently.
