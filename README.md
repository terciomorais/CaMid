# M-CaMid
Multi-Cloud-aware Middleware
M-CaMid (Multi-Cloud aware Middleware) is an object-oriented middleware specially designed for supporting the development and management of distributed applications in multi-cloud environments. The proposed middleware implements cloud elasticity at the middleware level and abstracts the underlying distribution complexities inherent to multi-cloud infrastructures. In practice, M-CaMid implements essential mechanisms to support: (i) communication between the application’s components distributed over multiple clouds; and (ii) management of distributed applications and their infrastructure resources with minimal human intervention by leveraging the cloud elasticity benefit automatically and transparently.

## Reproducible Experiment
This section discusses experiments to evaluate M-CaMid. The main goal is to assess the M-CaMid efficiency on the management of multi-cloud distributed applications by exploring elasticity at different levels of granularity and scopes. Considering the multi-cloud elasticity as the key element for cross-management, experiments plan to characterise its differences from common approaches. Common approaches selection depends on the type of experiment. For example, the exclusive use of infrastructure elasticity, referred here to coarse elasticity, is a reference approach to assess the M-CaMid cross management. Experiments’ sections describe methods in detail. A systematic approach for performance evaluation was adopted (Jain, 1991) to accomplish the experiments. First, some steps are defined to conduct the experiments: goals and system boundaries, scenarios, services and outcomes, metrics, parameters and factors, experiment design. Finally, results are presented.
